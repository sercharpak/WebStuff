0.1 to 0.2
-------------

* Core JavaBeans are now Serializable

* Fixed up bugs in tests due to data changes in MB service

* Amended BeanPopulator.getAlbum(Resource) to include boolean flag
   indicating whether the tracks should be fetch from the model. This is 
   a simple optimisation to avoid fetching more data than required from 
   model.
   
* Amended BeanPopulator.getTrack(Resource, Resource) to call
   getAlbum and thereby populate the basic album metadata (but not 
   tracks)

* Added com.ldodds.amazon.Amazon class, and Asin property

* Added get/setAmazonId to Album, and support in BeanPopulator to fetch the 
   literal asin from the model and populate it
   
* Added CHANGES.txt to keep track of progress   

* Added RecordCollectionRDFGenerator as a sample command-line application 
   that uses the API. It reads a list of albums from an input file, queries the API
   (assuming first match is always correct) and then constructs a new RDF document
   with the retrieved metadata. Needs work though.
   
* Added mm:country, mm:releaseDateList, mm:ReleaseDate to MM

* Added ReleaseDate class
